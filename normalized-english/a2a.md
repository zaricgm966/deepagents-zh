# A2A endpoint in Agent Server

> Use the A2A protocol to enable agent-to-agent communication with distributed tracing in LangSmith.

[Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) is Google's protocol for enabling communication between conversational AI agents. [LangSmith implements A2A support](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/server-api-ref#tag/a2a/post/a2a/\{assistant_id}), allowing your agents to communicate with other A2A-compatible agents through a standardized protocol.

The A2A endpoint is available in [Agent Server](/langsmith/agent-server) at `/a2a/{assistant_id}`.

## Protocol version

Agent Server speaks the A2A **v1.0** JSON-RPC binding and also accepts the v0.3 method names, so
existing v0.3 clients keep working. The agent card declares one interface:


```json
"supportedInterfaces": [
  {
    "url": "https://your-deployment/a2a/{assistant_id}",
    "protocolBinding": "JSONRPC",
    "protocolVersion": "1.0"
  }
]
```

  The method name you send also selects the enum case in the response. A v1.0 name returns
  SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE (`TASK_STATE_WORKING`, `ROLE_AGENT`); a v0.3 name returns lowercase
  (`working`, `agent`). Pick one family per client and stay on it.

  The envelope varies by method, not by family: `SendMessage` wraps the task in `result.task`, while
  `GetTask` and all v0.3 methods return it directly on `result`. `ListTasks` returns `result.tasks`.

## Supported methods

| v1.0 name                     | v0.3 name        | Supported                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `SendMessage`                 | `message/send`   | Yes                           |
| `SendStreamingMessage`        | `message/stream` | Yes — Server-Sent Events      |
| `GetTask`                     | `tasks/get`      | Yes                           |
| `CancelTask`                  | `tasks/cancel`   | Yes                           |
| `ListTasks`                   | —                | Yes                           |
| `GetExtendedAgentCard`        | —                | Yes, under the v1.0 name only |
| `SubscribeToTask`             | —                | Not yet — returns `-32601`    |
| `*TaskPushNotificationConfig` | —                | Not yet — returns `-32601`    |

Exactly four v0.3 names are accepted: `message/send`, `message/stream`, `tasks/get` and
`tasks/cancel`. Anything else — including `agent/getAuthenticatedExtendedCard` and
`tasks/resubscribe` — returns `-32601 Method not found`.

Only the JSON-RPC binding is available. gRPC and HTTP+JSON are not implemented.

### Task history in responses

A context holds many tasks. By default `SendMessage`, `GetTask` and `ListTasks` return the history
of the **whole context**, not just the task you asked about. The second task in a context replays
the first task's messages, so a client that renders every history entry shows earlier turns again —
including earlier tool results and A2UI payloads.

Set `historyScope` to `task` to get back only the messages that belong to the task you asked about.
The default stays `context`, so existing integrations are unaffected.

Where the option goes depends on the method. `SendMessage` reads it from `configuration`:


```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "1",
  "method": "SendMessage",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "role": "ROLE_USER",
      "parts": [{"text": "Second request"}],
      "messageId": "message-2",
      "contextId": "8b1f0e5c-9a3d-4f27-b0c8-2e6a5d4c1b7a"
    },
    "configuration": {"historyScope": "task"}
  }
}
```


`GetTask` and `ListTasks` read it directly from `params`:


```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "2", "method": "GetTask",
 "params": {"id": "<taskId>", "historyScope": "task"}}
```


If your client cannot add fields to the request body, send the header instead. An explicit value in
the request wins over the header.


```
LangGraph-A2A-History-Scope: task
```


The agent card advertises this under `capabilities.extensions`, so you can detect support rather
than assume it:


```json
{
  "uri": "https://langchain.com/a2a/extensions/history-scope/v1",
  "description": "Choose task-only or full-context response history",
  "required": false,
  "params": {
    "header": "LangGraph-A2A-History-Scope",
    "values": ["context", "task"],
    "default": "context",
    "methods": ["SendMessage", "GetTask", "ListTasks"]
  }
}
```


Three limits worth knowing:

* Streaming ignores both history options. `SendStreamingMessage` reads neither `historyScope` nor `historyLength`, and returns no error if you send them — so do not rely on either over SSE.
* `historyLength` caps at 10. A larger value returns `-32602` with `historyLength cannot exceed 10`.
* Scope is applied before `historyLength`, so you get the last N messages *of that task*.

An unrecognized value returns `-32602` with `historyScope must be 'context' or 'task'`. A mis-cased
key such as `historyscope` is not an error — it is ignored, and you silently get full-context
history, so check the spelling if filtering appears not to work.

  Do not resend a `taskId` from a completed task. Each new turn starts a new task inside the same
  context — send the `contextId` alone. A message naming a terminal task is rejected with `-32004`,
  and a `taskId` minted by another agent is rejected with `-32001`.

## Agent card discovery

Each assistant automatically exposes an A2A Agent Card that describes its capabilities and provides the information needed for other agents to connect. You can retrieve the agent card for any assistant using:


```
GET /.well-known/agent-card.json?assistant_id={assistant_id}
```


The agent card includes the assistant's name, description, available skills, supported input/output modes, and the A2A endpoint URL for communication.

## Optional capabilities

These are configured per assistant through `metadata.a2a` on the Assistants API. `langgraph.json`
cannot set assistant metadata, so patch the assistant after deploy.

### Declare input and output modes


```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "a2a": {
      "input_modes": ["text/plain", "application/pdf"],
      "output_modes": ["text/plain", "application/pdf"]
    }
  }
}
```


The values feed both the card's `defaultInputModes`/`defaultOutputModes` and the generated skill's
modes. They are advertisement only — an undeclared mode is still accepted. Replacement is per
field, so send both if you want both overridden, and note that an empty list is rejected.

### File parts

`FilePart` works in both directions. Inbound file, image, audio and video parts become LangChain
content blocks. Outbound content blocks map back to `FilePart`, in task history and in the final
streamed artifact. MIME types, URIs and filenames pass through unchanged; inline data is
re-encoded as standard base64.

### A2UI v0.9

Opt in per assistant:


```json
{ "metadata": { "a2a": { "a2ui": true } } }
```


The card then advertises the extension and appends the canonical MIME type to both mode lists:


```json
"capabilities": {
  "extensions": [
    {
      "uri": "https://a2ui.org/a2a-extension/a2ui/v0.9",
      "description": "Ability to render A2UI v0.9",
      "required": false,
      "params": {
        "v0.9": {
          "supportedCatalogIds": [],
          "acceptsInlineCatalogs": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


A client activates it by listing the URI in `message.extensions`. Payloads are validated in both
directions against the v0.9 schemas, and A2UI parts are preserved in `message/send`, `tasks/get`
and the final `message/stream` artifact. Responses carry
`metadata.mimeType: "application/a2ui+json"`. `application/json+a2ui` is accepted as an alias on
input.

### Filter tool results

By default every correlated tool result is published as a `DataPart`. To publish only some, set an
allowlist of tool names on the deployment:


```bash
A2A_ALLOWED_TOOL_CALL_RESULTS=generative_ui_tool,another_tool
```


Unset means all tool results are published. The filter applies to both task history and streaming.

## Requirements

| Feature                                      | Minimum version           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A2A endpoint                                 | `langgraph-api >= 0.4.21` |
| Inbound `FilePart`                           | `0.12.0`                  |
| Tool-result `DataPart`s                      | `0.12.2`                  |
| `A2A_ALLOWED_TOOL_CALL_RESULTS`              | `0.12.4`                  |
| Outbound `FilePart`, configurable card modes | `0.13.0`                  |
| A2UI v0.9                                    | `0.15.0`                  |
| `historyScope`                               | `0.15.0`                  |


```bash
pip install "langgraph-api>=0.13.0"
```


A2UI v0.9 and `historyScope` landed after the `0.14.0` release candidates were cut, so they arrive
in `0.15.0`. That version is not published as a stable release yet — check
`capabilities.extensions` on the agent card before relying on `historyScope`.

Your graph's state must include a `messages` key to accept A2A text and file parts. An assistant
whose input schema has no `messages` field is rejected with an explanatory error.

## Creating an A2A-compatible agent

This example creates an A2A-compatible agent that processes incoming messages using OpenAI's API and maintains conversational state. The agent defines a message-based state structure and handles the A2A protocol's message format.

To be compatible with the [A2A "text" parts](https://a2a-protocol.org/dev/specification/#651-textpart-object), the agent must have a `messages` key in state.

The A2A protocol uses two identifiers to maintain conversational continuity:

* `contextId`: Groups messages into a conversation thread (like a session ID)
* `taskId`: Identifies each individual request within that conversation

On the first message, omit both - the agent generates and returns them. For all subsequent messages in the conversation, send back the `contextId` from the prior response and omit `taskId`, so each turn opens a new task inside the same conversation. Send a `taskId` only to add to a task that is still running, such as one waiting on input.

**LangSmith Tracing:** The Langsmith Deployment A2A endpoint automatically converts the A2A `contextId` to `thread_id` for LangSmith tracing, grouping all messages in the conversation under a single thread.

For example:


```python
"""LangGraph A2A conversational agent.

Supports the A2A protocol with messages input for conversational interactions.
"""

## Agent-to-agent communication

Once your agents are running locally via `langgraph dev` or [deployed to production](/langsmith/deployment), you can facilitate communication between them using the A2A protocol.

This example demonstrates how two agents can communicate by sending JSON-RPC messages to each other's A2A endpoints. The script simulates a multi-turn conversation where each agent processes the other's response and continues the dialogue.


```python

## Distributed tracing

When multiple agents communicate over A2A, LangSmith can group all their [traces](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces) into a single [thread](/langsmith/observability-concepts#threads), which gives you a unified view of the entire multi-agent conversation.

### How contextId maps to thread\_id

The Agent Server A2A endpoint automatically converts the A2A `contextId` to `thread_id` for LangSmith tracing. This means every message in a conversation, across all participating agents, is grouped under the same thread in LangSmith without any extra configuration on your part.

The flow works as follows:

1. On the first message, the client omits `contextId`. The server generates one and returns it in the response.
2. The client passes the `contextId` in all subsequent messages to maintain conversation continuity.
3. Agent Server maps the `contextId` to `thread_id` in LangSmith [metadata](/langsmith/add-metadata-tags), so all turns appear in the same thread.

  The `contextId` is used directly as the LangGraph `thread_id`, so it must be a UUID. Echo back the
  one the server returned rather than minting your own identifier. A `contextId` such as
  `session-42` is rejected with `-32602` and the message `Failed to create run: Invalid thread ID`.

### Tracing across multiple agents

When agents from different frameworks communicate over A2A, `contextId` is what unifies their traces. Reuse the `contextId` returned by the first agent on every later request, to that agent and to the others.

  Agent Server does not read a top-level `metadata` field on the JSON-RPC payload. There is no way for a client to set the LangGraph `thread_id` directly — it is always the `contextId`. Sending `metadata.thread_id` to an Agent Server deployment has no effect.

The following code snippet demonstrates the key concepts. For a complete runnable implementation with two agents, refer to the [Google ADK + LangChain example](https://github.com/langchain-samples/A2A-google-adk/blob/main/test_agent_conversation.py).


```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import uuid


async def send_message(session, url, text, context_id=None):
    """Send an A2A message and return (response_text, context_id)."""

    # --- 1. Build the message ---
    # On follow-up turns, include contextId inside the message object so the server
    # associates them with the ongoing conversation. Do not resend taskId: each turn
    # opens a new task within that conversation.
    message = {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": text}],
        "messageId": str(uuid.uuid4()),
    }
    if context_id:
        message["contextId"] = context_id

    # --- 2. Send it ---
    # contextId travels inside the message. Agent Server turns it into the
    # LangGraph thread_id, so no separate tracing field is needed.
    payload = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "method": "message/send",
        "params": {"message": message},
    }

    async with session.post(url, json=payload, headers={"Accept": "application/json"}) as response:
        if response.status != 200:
            raise RuntimeError(f"HTTP {response.status}: {await response.text()}")
        result = await response.json()

    if "error" in result:
        raise RuntimeError(result["error"].get("message", "Unknown error"))

    result_obj = result.get("result", {})
    returned_context_id = result_obj.get("contextId") or context_id
    text_out = next(
        (
            part.get("text", "")
            for art in result_obj.get("artifacts", []) or []
            for part in art.get("parts", []) or []
            if part.get("kind") == "text"
        ),
        "(no text)",
    )
    return text_out, returned_context_id


async def run_conversation(agent_a_url, agent_b_url):
    # --- 3. Share the context across agents ---
    # The first response carries a contextId. Pass it to every agent from then
    # on, and all their traces land in one LangSmith thread.
    context_id = None
    message = "Hello! Let's collaborate."

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        for _ in range(3):
            message, context_id = await send_message(
                session, agent_a_url, message, context_id=context_id
            )

            message, context_id = await send_message(
                session, agent_b_url, message, context_id=context_id
            )


asyncio.run(run_conversation(
    "http://localhost:2024/a2a/<agent_a_assistant_id>",
    "http://localhost:2025/a2a/<agent_b_assistant_id>",
))
```


**1. Build the message**: Include `contextId` inside the `message` object on follow-up turns so the server can associate them with the ongoing conversation. Omit it on the first message, because the server generates a `contextId` and returns it in the response. Do not resend `taskId` from a finished turn.

**2. Send it**: The `contextId` travels inside `params.message`. Agent Server uses it as the LangGraph `thread_id`, so there is no separate tracing field to set.

**3. Share the context across agents**: Let the first agent mint the `contextId`, then pass that same value to every agent for the rest of the conversation. That is what groups their traces into one thread.

### Receive thread\_id in non-LangGraph agents

The [previous section](#tracing-across-multiple-agents) covers the client side — propagating `contextId` when sending messages. If one of your agents is not built on LangGraph, it also needs to read that `contextId` on the receiving end and attach it as the thread identifier, so its traces land in the same LangSmith thread. Use `langsmith.integrations.otel.configure()` to set up automatic tracing, and read `params.message.contextId` from the incoming A2A request.


```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from langsmith.integrations.otel import configure as configure_otel
from opentelemetry import trace
import json

# --- 1. Configure OTel ---
# Set up automatic tracing to LangSmith for your non-LangGraph agent.
configure_otel(project_name="my-a2a-project")
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

app = FastAPI()

async def set_thread_id_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    thread_id = None
    if request.method == "POST":
        body_bytes = await request.body()
        if body_bytes:
            # --- 2. Extract contextId from the incoming A2A message ---
            try:
                body = json.loads(body_bytes)
                thread_id = body["params"]["message"].get("contextId")
            except (ValueError, KeyError, TypeError):
                pass
            # Re-inject the body so downstream handlers can still read it
            async def receive():
                return {"type": "http.request", "body": body_bytes}
            request._receive = receive

    # --- 3. Attach thread_id to the trace ---
    # langsmith.metadata.thread_id groups this trace with others in the same thread.
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("agent") as span:
        if thread_id:
            span.set_attribute("langsmith.metadata.thread_id", thread_id)
        return await call_next(request)
```


Register your agent routes on `app` after this middleware.

  Set `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and optionally `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` in your environment to enable tracing. All agents in the conversation should use the same project so their traces are visible together.

### View traces in LangSmith

After running a multi-agent conversation, open the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=cta\&utm_campaign=langsmith-signup\&utm_content=langsmith-server-a2a) and navigate to **Threads**. All turns from all participating agents will appear under a single thread, identified by the shared `thread_id`.

## Test your integration

### Against your own deployment

Fetch the card, then send a message:


```bash
curl "https://your-deployment/a2a/{assistant_id}/.well-known/agent-card.json"
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-deployment/a2a/{assistant_id}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "SendMessage",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "role": "ROLE_USER",
        "parts": [{"text": "hello"}],
        "messageId": "test-1"
      }
    }
  }'
```


The response contains `result.task.id` and `result.task.contextId`. Reuse the `contextId` on the
next message to continue the conversation.

For streaming, send `Accept: text/event-stream` and use `SendStreamingMessage`. The first event is
the `Task`; status and artifact updates follow.

### Against the official conformance suite

A2A publishes a Technology Compatibility Kit at
[a2aproject/a2a-tck](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-tck). It grades an implementation by
RFC 2119 level and works against any A2A endpoint, including yours.


```bash
./run_tck.py --sut-host https://your-deployment/a2a/{assistant_id} --transport jsonrpc
```

  The TCK drives some scenarios through `messageId` prefixes such as `tck-input-required`, described
  in its `docs/SUT_REQUIREMENTS.md`. A graph that does not implement those prefixes will report those
  requirements as skipped rather than failed.

### What Agent Server currently fails

Agent Server runs the TCK on every CI build as a required check, gated against a checked-in list of
known failures. CI fails if a new failure appears, and also if a listed requirement starts passing,
so the list cannot drift from what the server actually does.

Read this before you build against a capability:

| Gap                               | What you observe                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Response wire shape is still v0.3 | Tasks, messages and parts carry `kind` and `mimeType` instead of v1.0 member-presence discrimination |
| Streaming events are flat         | SSE emits v0.3 objects with `final`, not `statusUpdate` / `artifactUpdate` wrappers                  |
| `tool_results` is snake\_case     | v1.0 expects `toolResults`. Kept deliberately, because live A2UI clients read this key               |
| Timestamps                        | Serialized as `+00:00` rather than an ISO 8601 `Z` suffix                                            |
| `SubscribeToTask`                 | Returns `-32601` where the spec requires `-32001`                                                    |
| Push notification config          | Returns `-32601` where the spec requires `-32003`                                                    |
| Errors carry no `data`            | No `google.rpc.ErrorInfo` reason or domain is attached                                               |
| `A2A-Version` request header      | Not read, so an unsupported version is processed instead of returning `-32009`                       |
| Agent card caching                | No `Cache-Control`, `ETag` or `Last-Modified` headers                                                |
| `GetExtendedAgentCard`            | Served, but never advertised via `capabilities.extendedAgentCard`                                    |

## Disable A2A

To disable the A2A endpoint, set `disable_a2a` to `true` in your `langgraph.json` configuration file:


```json
{
  "$schema": "https://langgra.ph/schema.json",
  "http": {
    "disable_a2a": true
  }
}
```

        The whole body runs inside a shielded cancel scope. Cleanup is
        routinely reached while the caller's task is being cancelled (e.g.
        `async with ClaudeSDKClient()` unwinding on cancel), and an
        unshielded close() would abort at the first await — before the
        terminate/kill escalation ran — orphaning the CLI child, which then
        surfaces as `<defunct>` once nothing is left to wait() on it.

        Every await in *this* scope is bounded (~20s worst case), so an anyio
        cancellation is delayed but never blocked: the stream `aclose()`s are a
        non-blocking `close()` plus a checkpoint on both anyio backends (they
        never await `wait_closed()`, so undrained stdin cannot wedge them), the
        stderr task is cancelled before it is awaited, and the lock acquire and
        every process `wait()` carry an explicit deadline.

        Caveat: an anyio shield only defers cancellation that *originates from
        an anyio cancel scope*. A raw asyncio cancellation (`asyncio.wait_for` /
        `asyncio.timeout` firing, a bare `task.cancel()`, loop shutdown) is
        still delivered at the next await in here, and the escalation below only
        catches `TimeoutError` — so it would be skipped. That is a pre-existing
        limitation of the shield on the asyncio backend rather than something
        this scope introduces, and it is still strictly better than before: the
        `finally` keeps a still-running child in `_ACTIVE_CHILDREN` for the
        atexit reaper instead of dropping it. Making the escalation robust to a
        foreign `CancelledError` is a follow-up.
